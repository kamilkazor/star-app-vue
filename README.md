## about the project:
Star-app-vue is a simple vue training project. The app utilizes vue-router for navigation, pinia as a simple store
and vue-query for handling communication with the [SWAPI API](https://swapi.dev/).
The project also uses @vueuse/head for dynamic titles and zod for validation of API responses and form input.
For the styling tailwind css was used. Finally, the app was tested with the help of vitest and vue testing-library.
